# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## Toy App

This is the second application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/). 

You can create new users (the app requires you to enter a name and e-mail) and new microposts (which need to have an user id attached to them and cannot be longer than 140 characters long - just as Twitter). You can see it live [here](https://secure-fortress-49127.herokuapp.com).
